***CODE TAKEN AN EDITED FROM LAB 6***

## **Part 1 - Debugging Scenario**
Student Question
---
When testing the grade.sh bash script the tests come in as follows a success, and a failure respectively for the 2 different git repositories used. I'm having trouble understanding why I am getting the correct output, however there is only one test passing through. Could you help me by pointing me in the right direction?
