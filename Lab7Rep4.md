* I found the url I needed, copied it and typed "git clone" and then pasted the link into the terminal. This cloned the git repository.

* I typed "bash test.sh" to run and test the code within the repository. This returned 2 test successfully running and 1 test returns as failed.

* I edited the code by typing "vim ListExamples.java". This opened the file within a vim editor space. I then hit *down* key 43 times and *right* key 11 times to reach the error within the code. To correct it I hit "x i 2 *esc* :wq". This fixed the error in the code and saved the file.

* I hit *up* *up* *enter* because the run test bash command was within the terminal history, so I accessed it and ran the same command.
