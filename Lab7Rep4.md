* Typed *`<ssh>`* and then *`<Ctrl> + v`* my login information. This logged me into the remote computer.
* The full command with the terminal was *`<ssh cs15lfa23dq@ieng6.ucsd.edu>`*

---
* I found the url I needed, copied it and typed *`<git clone>`* and then pasted the link into the terminal.
* The full command written within the terminal was *`git clone https://github.com/JAgui13/lab7`*.
* This cloned the git repository.

---
* I typed *`bash test.sh`* to run and test the code within the repository. This returned 2 test successfully running and 1 test returns as failed.

---
* I edited the code by typing *`vim ListExamples.java`*. This opened the file within a vim editor space. I then hit the *`<down>`* key 43 times and the *`<right>`* key 11 times to reach the error within the code. To correct the bug I hit the *`x`* *`i`* *`2`* *`<esc>`* *`<shift> + ;`* (:) *`w`* *`q`* keys in that order. These inputs fixed the error within the code and saved the file.

---
* I hit *`<up>`* *`<up>`* *`<enter>`* because the command to run the test bash command (*`bash test.sh`*) was within the terminal history, so I accessed it and hit *`<enter>`*, to run the same command.

---
* I wrote the *`git push`* and *`git commit`* commands wihtin the terminal with the message being "Updated to pass both tests" as the change comment.
* This commited the changes to the git repositroy and saved my work.
